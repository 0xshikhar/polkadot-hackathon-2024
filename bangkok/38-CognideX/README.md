## Introduction
-- project name  
CognideX

-- project creation date  
N/A

-- project background, including github link before, won any rewards before, got any grant from web3 foundation and so on  
CognideX is a decentralized data marketplace built within the Polkadot ecosystem. The project incentivizes users with CGDX tokens based on the quality of the data they provide. It uses blockchain technology for data verification and privacy preservation.  
No grant received from Web3 Foundation yet.

-- the problem the project tries to resolve  
CognideX resolves the problem of data monetization and authenticity by providing a decentralized platform where users can contribute data anonymously while earning rewards for data quality. It also aims to address the issue of fragmented data sources by merging all user data into a single, secure pool for better insights.

## Features planned for the Hackathon
-- The status of project before participating in the Hackathon  
The project is in development, with the core idea and some architecture in place. Data pools, token incentive mechanisms, and privacy features are implemented to a basic extent.

-- Features planned for the Hackathon  
- Enhanced privacy features using anonymous identifiers.  
- Full implementation of AI-powered data merging.  
- LLM-powered insights generation system.  
- Optimization of incentive structure based on data quality.

## Architect
-- Diagram of architect for the project  
(Not provided)

-- Description for each component  
1. **Data Pools:** Where users submit their data, and it is assessed for quality to receive CGDX tokens.
2. **Main Data Pool:** A unified pool created from all individual Data Pools for aggregated insights.
3. **Privacy Layer:** Ensures that usersâ€™ PII is masked and replaced with anonymous identifiers.
4. **AI Module:** Responsible for merging the data and producing the unified data pool.
5. **LLM Agent:** Interacts with the user to provide insights from the data pool based on their queries.

## Schedule
-- Timeline for all activities of your project during Hackathon  
- Week 1: Setup privacy-preserving data pools and integrate the AI-powered merging module.  
- Week 2: Implement the LLM-powered insights engine.  
- Week 3: Conduct internal testing of the system and resolve any issues.  
- Week 4: Prepare the final submission and complete documentation.

-- Important milestones like first submit, pre-demo, testnet  
- First submit: End of Week 1.  
- Pre-demo: Week 3.  
- Testnet: Week 4.

-- Completed features, tests, docs, or in production  
- Privacy-preserving data pools.  
- Basic AI merging.  
- LLM integration.  
- Testnet deployment scheduled.
