## Project Details

### Introducing PlayVerse

PlayVerse's vision is to create an immersive, impartial and inclusive ecosystem for web3 gamers worldwide. It is a Web3 Game Streaming & Community Management Platform built on Polkadot's Substrate framework.

### Problem To Be Solved

- Centralized streaming platforms exploit streamers' hard work and community influence through unfair compensation practices, lacking transparency and consensus.
- Gamers invest significant time and money in games without receiving ownership, alignment, or governance, highlighting the absence of a GameFi streaming infrastructure for crypto and NFT payouts.
- Transitioning from web2 game publishers' methods of acquiring and retaining users (paid ads, paid media) to a Web3 approach based on contribution (airdrops, referrals, engagement) is needed.

### ðŸ’¡ Idea / Solution

PlayVerse is an interactive online gaming and learning platform built as a Substrate-based blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem. This architecture enables seamless interoperability with other parachains in the Polkadot network, enhancing the platform's capabilities for cross-chain gaming assets and interactions.

The next evolutionary step is towards the GameFi streaming platform. Create a sustainable ecosystem running on Substrate where game publishers, streamers and the gamer community all benefit from the contribution through Polkadot's robust security and scalability features.

We empower streamers by utilizing Substrate's native capabilities to:
- Eliminate high commission rates
- Implement transparent governance mechanisms
- Reduce fund holding periods through efficient consensus
- Provide clear guidelines regarding account management based on legal matters
- Ensure complete transparency through on-chain data
- Foster community consensus through native democracy features

By leveraging Polkadot's interoperable blockchain infrastructure, we restore the integrity of the streaming ecosystem and bolster the invaluable influence and support that streamers have diligently cultivated.
