### Figo - Pop Toys, on Polkadot, for Games üïπÔ∏è

- Created in August 2024

---

Figo is a mobile application-based decentralized app (DApp) designed to revolutionize the collectible figure experience by bridging the physical and digital realms on Polkadot, offering a dynamic phygital experience where ownership, gaming, and creativity converge in a single, innovative platform.

### Problems

---

Traditionally, collectible figures are primarily physical, and while they offer aesthetic or sentimental value, their utility remains limited to being displayed or stored in personal collections. The traditional way of collecting these figures means that users cannot engage with them in digital spaces, missing out on additional value and interactive experiences. Moreover, managing both physical and digital collections can be cumbersome and disjointed, leading to fragmented ownership and lacking of streamlined utility.

üî¥ **Limited Interactions and Utility:**

Physical collectible figures are often restricted to passive use, such as being displayed on a shelf or stored away, offering no engagement beyond their presence. Collectors are unable to interact with their figures in meaningful ways, and the collectible‚Äôs value remains largely static.

üî¥ **Lack of Digital Ownership Integration:**

Traditional collectible figures do not leverage digital ownership, meaning collectors cannot verify, transfer, or monetize them within the growing world of digital assets. Without a digital counterpart, these collectible figures are left out of the broader ecosystem of blockchain-based ownership and trading.

üî¥ **Fragmented Collection Management:**

Managing physical and digital collections separately can be inefficient and cumbersome, requiring collectors to navigate different platforms and systems. Collectors often lack a streamline way to view, manage, or interact with their collectible figures, resulting in a disjointed experience.

üî¥ **Limited Value of Collecting:**

While collecting collectible figures can be rewarding, their inherent value is often limited based on rarity or sentimental attachment. Without digital utility or interactive elements, traditional collectible figures miss opportunities for value appreciation and engagement beyond initial acquisition.

**In summary, traditional collectible figures offer limited engagement, disconnected ownership experiences, and fragmented management, leaving collectors with their collectible figures that lack utility in the digital world.** 

### üí°Inspirations

---

The inspiration for Figo comes from the growing popularity of collectible figures such as Pop Mart and the functionality of Amiibo. Amiibo, in particular, allows users to scan their physical collectibles and interact with them as digital assets in a gaming environment. Building on this concept, the idea emerged to take it a step further by turning these assets into NFTs on the blockchain. This approach enables not only the verification of ownership but also facilitates trading, gaming, and seamless management of collectibles, all within a single platform, enhancing the interactive experience for collectors.

‚ú® Digital assets are highly secure and decentralized

‚ú® Improve interactivity with their assets in new ways and enhancing experience

‚ú® Easier trading of collectibles in digital marketplace

‚ú® Value of collectible figures increases by enhancing their figures with gears in form of NFTs

‚ú® Seamless asset management for tracking, displaying and interacting with your assets

### Existing Solutions and Challenges

---

Amiibo offers an unique way to interact with physical collectibles by allowing users to scan their figures and unlock digital content with compatible games. This integration adds a layer of interactivity to physical figures, engaging with them in gaming environment and gaining special rewards or perks. However, Amiibo figures lack of secure ownership verification and unable to trade them as digital assets, which reduces their potential as valuable, tradable assets in digital marketplace.

### Figo - NFC-Powered Phygital NFTs for Interactive¬†Gaming (Solution)

---

Figo addresses the limitations of physical collectible figures by combining NFC-tag technology, blockchain, NFTs, and gaming to create an interactive and dynamic collecting experience. Here's how Figo solves these key challenges:

- **Wallet Connection and NFT Minting:** Figo offers a streamlined onboarding experience through NFC-tag technology. After connecting to Nethereum wallet, simply scan the NFC tag embedded in the collectible figure. This action triggers the minting process, allowing you to sign the transaction and create a unique digital Equippable NFT securely stored in your wallet. Each NFT enhances the value of your phygital assets by establishing verified ownership and authenticity on the Moonbeam network. This unique system creates monetizing opportunities, as users can resell their phygital assets, transferring both the physical item and its associated digital identity.
- **Dynamic Equippable NFTs:** Figo utilizes ERC-6220 equippable NFTs based on the RMRK standard, allowing users to mint parent NFTs from their collectible figures and enhance them with dynamic child NFTs, referred to as gears. This feature transforms static collectibles into interactive digital assets that enhance gameplay and utility.
- **No Gas Fees for Users:** Figo enhances the user experience by incorporating a treasurer account that covers gas fees on behalf of the users. With the use of a call permit from Moonbeam, Figo ensures that users don‚Äôt have to worry about the typical transaction costs associated with blockchain operations. This means that every interaction with NFT. Whether it's minting, equipping, unequipping, or purchasing new child NFTs can be done without needing to hold native tokens for gas fees.
- **Gamified Interaction and Rewards:** Figo includes a control panel where users can test their NFTs in a game-like environment, earn rewards, and use those rewards to upgrade their digital collectibles. This adds value and engagement to the overall experience.

### Proof of Concept: Our Implementation Prototype for Figo

---

The implementation prototype that we presenting in our demo video is built using C# .NET MAUI as our mobile app development and using API calls to interact with the backend in Node.js which able to showcase and proving the feasibility of Figo. Below diagram is a high-level architecture design of our Figo project.
